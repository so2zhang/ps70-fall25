<h3>Week 1: Final Project Proposal</h3>

<p class = "margin"></p>
At this moment, I have 2 ideas for my final project.
<p class = "margin"></p>

<h4>Idea 1: SMART WATER HARVESTER</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

<p class = "margin"></p>
<p>For my project, I plan to build a small fog-harvesting device inspired by cactus spines. I will design and fabricate panels using the laser cutter or 3D printer, 
  with alternating hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces to help droplets form and flow. The panels will be mounted on a base 
  that can tilt based on input from sensors measuring humidity, temperature, and wind. 
  A microcontroller will control the system, collect data, and log how much water is harvested. If time allows, I may try to explore networking multiple harvesters together. 
  It'd also be cool to try and get it to be bluetooth enabled so as to connect to other devices. I ultimately want to not just to copy natural designs, but combine biomimicry with smart sensing and optimization to improve water collection.</p>


<h4>Idea 2: SMART ARCH</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>


<p class = "margin"></p>
<p>For this idea, I plan to create a custom insole with a pressure sensor array that shows real-time foot pressure distribution on an LED or phone app. 
  I will design and fabricate the insole using the laser cutter or 3D printer, embedding a grid of pressure sensors throughout. 
  A microcontroller will read the sensor data and control the display, providing feedback on foot pressure patterns. 
  If time allows, I may explore adding haptic feedback to alert users to high-pressure areas. 
  My goal is to create a functional and informative insole that helps users improve their foot health and comfort.
  I personally have really flat feet and have struggled to find a supportive shoe, so I think this would be a really fun project ot work on.
