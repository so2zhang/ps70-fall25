<h4>Assignment 1: Make a Box</h4>
<p>For this assignment, I followed a tutorial from Hobbyist Maker on automatically sized 
  finger joint boxes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9U2JPfkQpsE. I customized the number of fingers on each side 
  to reduce kerf and chose the dimensions 350mm x 250mm x 150mm because those were the average dimensions
  of a male shoebox. I used 6mm wide cardboard for the material and laser-cutting portion.

  After putting the box together, I found that the fit was still a bit loose likely due to kerf, so I added some hot glue to the joints to make it more secure. Overall, this was my first time using Fusion 360/CAD software
  (apart from the lab tutorial) as well as a laser cutter, and I felt so awesome trying both technologies out! Pretty satisfied as well with the ultimate result given that it is my first time :D

  The two models additional Fusion360 I made were a AA battery and a nut/bolt. Using the external jaws 
  of the calipar, I found that the diameter was approximately 14mm. I followed this tutorial from Youtuber CAD Jungle: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ga4mE6EACo
  to make the battery. I tried to make the appearance more battery-like by switching up the colors of the surfaces.

  Next, to make the nut and bolt, I measured the diameter of the bolt to be approximately 3mm. I followed a Youtube tutorial from The Fusion Essentials: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt5W-4y8r5I. 
  I found this tutorial to be super helpful because it explained how to use the thread tool in Fusion 360, which I had no idea about before. I also learned how to use the circular pattern tool to make the hexagonal shape of the nut.
